# Web-Scraping-Egypt-Instagram-Top-Influncers
The goal of this script is to scrape the names of the top 100 Instagram influencers in Egypt and then scrape the data about their Instagram activity  data for further analysis
The first part of the project scrape the top 100 Influencers names from the given website using beautiful soup 
the other part accesses the other given website using Selenium then passes the Influencer name as an argument for the website to analyze the data after that we use Beautifulsoup to scrape the data and repeat the process over the 100 accounts
note: I preferred using Beautiful soap for scraping to fasten the process for the second part of the project although selenium can be used to scrape the data too.
